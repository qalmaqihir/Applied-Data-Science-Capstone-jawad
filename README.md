# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
### IBM Data Science certificate

The commercial space age is here. Companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. The most successful is SpaceX. One of the SpaceX’s accomplishments includes sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars. Other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. The second stage helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by the first stage. This stage does most of the work and is much larger than the second stage. Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 Can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer. 

In this capstone, we will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company SpaceY, that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. Our job is to determine the price of each launch. We will do this by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards. We will determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage by training a machine learning model and using public information.
